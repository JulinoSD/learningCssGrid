# learningCssGrid
In that repository i'll try to learn more about CSS Grid as well, the same way i'm doing with other repo, all ways trying to get better and tracking some great oportunity (i don't talking about money, but, the oportunity to work and getting some money to pay bills) to work.

You will find here good things that you can do with CSS3 (just for begginer, of course), like border-radius with 8 points full control.

#### All those things are just for my curiosity and pratice, 'cause my goal is just to learn more about developing and program things thats useble for all, and to get some money too (I believe that this day will come, suderly near, is going to come)

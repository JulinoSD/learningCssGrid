# learningCssGrid
In that repository i'll try to learn more about **CSS3** (_Cascade Style Sheets_), and **React-hook-form**, the same way i'm doing with other repo, all ways trying to get better and tracking some great oportunity to work.

You will find here good things that you can do with CSS3 (it getting when you are begginer, of course), like **border-radius**, **border-radius with 8 points full control**, **Styled-components**, **test** (**_in Jest library_**)_  and validattion.

#### All those things are just for my curiosity and pratice, 'cause my goal is just to learn more about developing and program things thats can be used for all, and to get some money too.

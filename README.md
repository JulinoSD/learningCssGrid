![particles and ...rest](Back.png)
That's some of my places to pratice **_Javascript_**, and **_CSS3_**, and i'd like to say "my favorite place", but its just 'cause, is more easy then other projects, hehehehe, so i got my favorite, buts not my favorite one.

In that repository i'll try to learn more about CSS Grid as well, the same way i'm doing with other repo, all ways trying to get better and tracking some great oportunity (i don't talking about money, but, the oportunity to work and getting some money to pay bills) to work.

You will find here good things that you can do with CSS3 (it getting when you are begginer, of course), like **border-radius**, **border-radius with 8 points full control**, **Styled-components**, **test** (**_in Jest library_**)_  and validattion.

#### All those things are just for my curiosity and pratice, 'cause my goal is just to learn more about developing and program things thats can be used for all, and to get some money too.
